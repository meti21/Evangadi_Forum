# Team Announcement: New Git Workflow

Hi Team,

We're implementing a new Git workflow effective immediately. This standardized process will help us maintain code quality and reduce merge conflicts.

## New Git Workflow Process

### 1. Start with Main Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
*Switch to main and pull the latest changes*

### 2. Work on Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout your-branch-name
git pull origin main
```
*Switch to your feature branch and merge latest main changes*

**If conflicts occur during the pull:**
```bash
# Resolve conflicts in your editor, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts with main"
```
*Edit conflicted files, stage resolved changes, and commit*

### 3. Make and Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Clear, descriptive commit message"
git push origin your-branch-name
```
*Stage, commit, and push your changes*

### 4. Create Pull Request
Create a Pull Request from your branch to main for code review and merging.

## Why This Change?

Our previous workflow was causing several issues:
- Frequent merge conflicts between team members
- Inconsistent code versions across different machines
- Unstable main branch affecting deployments

This new workflow addresses these problems by:
- Keeping the main branch stable and deployable
- Ensuring all changes go through code review
- Reducing merge conflicts through regular main updates
- Creating a clear audit trail of all changes

## Implementation

Please begin using this workflow for all development work starting today. If you have questions about any step in the process, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks for your cooperation in making our development process more reliable and efficient!
